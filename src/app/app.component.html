      Therapeutic
      Through a combination of several styles, our technicians utilize your body's responses to guide their caring hands to provide the level of therapeutic touch your muscles require. By pulling from a variety of styles, like deep tissue, reflexology, gentle touch, and aromatherapy, we are able to release the tension within your body in a manner which best suits your needs.
      
      Prenatal
      Special care is provided during this joyous time of a woman's life, as we provide therapeutic work to your body. As your body goes through dramatic changes, a prenatal massage can help ease the body's tensions and help increase or enhance the functions of the muscles and joints, improve circulation and general body tone, and relieve mental and physical fatigue.
